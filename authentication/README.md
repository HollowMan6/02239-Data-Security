## Introduction
(max 1 page)

The introduction should provide a general introduction to the problem of authentication in client/server applications. It should define the scope of the answer, i.e. explicitly state what problems are considered, and outline the proposed solution. Finally, it should clearly state which of the identified goals are met by the developed software.

## Authentication
(max 3 pages)

This section should provide a short introduction to the specific problem of password based authentication in client/server systems and analyse the problems relating to password storage (on the server), password transport (between client and server) and password verification.

## Design and Implementation
(max 3 pages including diagrams)

A software design for the proposed solution must be presented and explained, i.e. why is this particular design chosen. The implementation of the designed authentication mechanism in the client server application must also be outlined in this section.

## Evaluation
(max 2 pages)

This section should document that the requirements defined in Section 2 have been satisfied by the implementation. In particular, the evaluation should demonstrate that the user is always authenticated by the server before the service is invoked, e.g. the username and methodname may be written to a logfile every time a service is invoked.
The evaluation should provide a simple summary of which of the requirements are satisfied and which are not.

## Conclusion
(max 1 page)

The conclusions should summarize the problems addressed in the report and clearly identify which of the requirements are satisfied and which are not (a summary of Section 4). The conclusions may also include a brief outline of future work.
