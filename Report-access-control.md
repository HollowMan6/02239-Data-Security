## Introduction
<!-- > (max 1 page)
> The introduction should provide a general introduction to the problem of access control in client/server applications. It should define the scope of the answer, i.e. explicitly state what problems are considered, and outline the proposed solution. Finally, it should clearly state which of the identified goals are met by the developed software. -->

## Access Control Lists
<!-- > (max 2 pages)
> This section should provide a short overview of the implementation of the access control lists and the motivation behind all non-trivial design choices. -->

## Role Based Access Control
<!-- > (max 3 pages including diagrams)
> This section should document the results of the role mining process performed in in Task 2 and provide a short overview of the implementation of the role based access control mechanism implemented in Task 3 along with the motivation behind all non-trivial design choices. In particular, it must describe the syntax used to specify the RBAC policy. -->

## Evaluation
<!-- > (max 4 pages)
> This section should document that the prototype enforces the access control policies defined in this assignment; both ACL and RBAC and both before and after the changes.
The evaluation should provide a simple summary of which of the requirements are satisfied and which are not. -->

## Discussion
<!-- > (max 2 page)
> This section documents the reflections and discussions of the final task. -->

## Conclusion
<!-- > (max 1 page)
> The conclusions should summarize the problems addressed in the report and clearly identify which of the requirements are satisfied and which are not (a summary of Section 4). The conclusions may also include a brief outline of future work. -->
